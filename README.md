# Hello! 👋

My name is **Queb**. As a *passionate coder*, I am proficient in a wide array of programming languages, including Python 🐍, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, and Go.

My professional journey centers around designing and implementing *cutting-edge software solutions*. I'm known for delivering comprehensive outcomes, employing my experience with virtual machines, Docker 🐳, Docker Compose, and Nginx. I've successfully set up robust email servers 📫 with Docker and Mailcow, a testament to my adaptability in handling diverse tech.

One of my areas of expertise is developing *statistical systems to interface with Firebird 3.0 databases* 📈. These systems bring to the fore key endpoints that collect and showcase critical metrics from emergency service 911 calls 🚑. My contributions have significantly impacted the monitoring and analysis of vital data.

I've also shown my prowess by creating real-time maps showcasing points of interest 🌍 and executing advanced mathematical operations using Numpy. A foray into the realm of *natural language processing* has seen me working with transformers, tokenization, and neural network training 🧠, further cementing the breadth of my AI experience.

With a robust command of SQL, I've proved my competence in managing and analyzing databases 🗃.

To me, each project is an opportunity to grow, learn, and deliver results that surpass expectations. The future of technology excites me, and I am eager to continue my journey 🚀.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I hope you derive as much joy from my work as I do in creating it! 😊
